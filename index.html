      <h2>In 2006, the State University of
        New York-Morrisville (SUNYMorrisville) campus installed the
        college’s first small wind system, a
        10 kW Bergey Excel. A meteorological
        (met) tower was installed in 2009; a
        second system, a Xzeres Skystream
        3.7, went up in 2013. Students in the
        Renewable Energy (RE) program were
        able to apply their classroom instruction
        in wind resource site assessment, and
        practice technical skills in <a href="https://tech.eu/2023/08/25/metroc-raises-2m-construction-projects-using-ai/">wind system</a>
        installation and troubleshooting. 
        <br></br>
        The campus sits at the geographic center
        of New York State, in a rural agricultural
        landscape with mountain ridges and
        a patchwork of cropland and forests.
        At the convergence of westerly winds
        from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, there is a strong wind resource at the ridge tops.
        However, due to the complex terrain,
        wind site assessment is challenging.
        While most of the campus is in a
        valley, the Dairy Complex sits on a hilltop,
        and was chosen as the wind lab location.
        Only 0.5 miles south of the main campus,
        it is close enough for easy access during
        labs, and has a large enough electrical
        load to warrant RE systems. The site is on
        a hilltop within a bowl, with ridges to the
        northwest, west, and southwest that are
        100 to 300 feet higher in elevation. This
        is particularly concerning because those
        are the <a href="https://tech.eu/2023/08/25/metroc-raises-2m-construction-projects-using-ai/">prevailing wind directions</a>. 
        The
        ridge tops are all less than 1 mile from the
        turbine sites.        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Installing an anemometer prior to installing
        a turbine is a good way to determine site
        suitability if you can measure wind speed for a fairly lengthy
        period of time (6+ months) as close to the proposed hub height
        as possible. A home weather station with an anemometer and
        wind vane will not be effective unless it is at least 30 feet above
        and 500 feet away from obstructions.
        In 2009, to better understand the wind resource and
        its influence on energy production and long-term turbine
        maintenance, RE installation company Sustainable Energy
        Development and the students installed a guyed, tilt-up met
        tower. The tower is outfitted with anemometers—which
        measure wind speed at 71, 102, and 122 feet above ground
        level—and a wind vane for recording wind direction at 100 feet.
        Anemometers were also installed on the Bergey tower at 71 feet
        and 102 feet as control points for the met-tower anemometers.

        Finland might be famous for its open prisons—where inmates can work or study in nearby towns—but this is not one of them. Instead, Hämeenlinna is the country’s highest-security institution housing exclusively female inmates. Marmalade has been sentenced to six years. Under privacy rules set by the prison, WIRED is not able to publish Marmalade’s real name, exact age, or any other information that could be used to identify her. But in a country where prisoners serving life terms can apply to be released after 12 years, six years is a heavy sentence. And like the other 100 inmates who live here, she is not allowed to leave.

        When Marmalade first arrived, she would watch the other women get up and go to work each morning: they could volunteer to clean, do laundry, or sew their own clothes. And for a six hour shift, they would receive roughly €6 ($6.50). But Marmalade couldn’t bear to take part. “I would find it very tiring,” she says. Instead she was spending long stretches of time in her cell. When a prison counselor suggested she try “AI work,” the short, three-hour shifts appealed to her, and the money was better than nothing. “Even though it’s not a lot, it’s better than staying in the cell,” she says” She’s only done three shifts so far, but already she feels a sense of achievement.
        <br></br>
        This is one of three Finnish prisons where inmates can volunteer to earn money through data labor. In each one, there are three laptops set up for inmates to take part in this AI work. There are no targets. Inmates are paid by the hour, not by their work’s speed or quality. In Hämeenlinna, around 20 inmates have tried it out, says Minna Inkinen, a prison work instructor, with cropped red hair, who sits alongside Marmalade as we talk. “Some definitely like it more than others”. When I arrive at the prison on a Wednesday morning, the sewing room is already busy. Inmates are huddled over sewing machines or conferring in pairs over mounds of fabric. But the small room where the AI work takes place is entirely empty until Marmalade arrives. There are only three inmates in total who regularly volunteer for AI shifts, Inkinen says, explaining that the other two are currently in court. “I would prefer to do it in a group,” says Marmalade, adding that she keeps the door open so she can chat with the people sewing next door, in between answering questions.
        <br></br>
        Those questions have been manually written in an office 100 kilometers south of the prison, in a slick Helsinki coworking space. Here, I meet Metroc’s tall and boyish founder and CEO, Jussi Virnala. He leads me to a stiflingly hot phone booth, past a row of indoor swings, a pool table, and a series of men in suits. It’s an exciting week, he explains, with a grin. The company has just <a href="https://tech.eu/2023/08/25/metroc-raises-2m-construction-projects-using-ai/">announced </a>€2 million ($2.1 million) funding round which he plans to use to expand across the Nordics. The investors he spoke with were intrigued by the company’s connection to Finland’s prisons, he says. “Everyone was just interested in and excited about what an innovative way to do it,” says Virnala. “I think it’s been really valuable product-wise.”
        <br></br>
        It was Virnala’s idea to turn to the prisons for labor. The company needed native Finnish speakers to help improve its large language model’s understanding of the construction-specific language. But in a high-wage economy like Finland, finding those data laborers was difficult. The Finnish welfare system’s generous unemployment benefits leaves little incentive for Finns to sign up to low-wage clickwork platforms like Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. “Mechanical Turk didn’t have many Finnish-language workers,” says Virnala. At the same time, he adds, automatic translation tools are still no good at Finnish, a language with only 5 million native speakers.
