      <h3>Does the internet dream of…?</h3>
      <h4>Reflections on the networks we live with, and internet futures that have yet to arrive</h4>
      <br></br>
      <h5>The resyndicatable web</h5> 
      <h2>“Does the internet dream of physical spaces?” A hypothetical question someone could have, quickly scrawled in mid-thought, posted on a message board in the early-aughts that has since disappeared from its now expired domain. Perhaps to be reanimated by the Internet Archive in the near-future—reshared on a federated social network, accessible only by an alpha-numeric sequence of letters and numbers described by users as a “hash”, re-syndicated through a decades old protocol (three times removed from its original intent), transmitted through conduits of optical fiber crossing continental distances, buried and submerged—everywhere and nowhere at the same time.
      </h2> <br></br>
      <h2>The originating context of the question may have been a reflection on William Gibson’s expression of cyberspace as “a consensual hallucination”.1 Stretching this narrative, we could imagine the author of the original post asking further: what is the hallucination we are in and how can we reshape our current imaginaries of the internet? These resulting questions point to the investigations Hypha has been undertaking through the micro-residency with From Later and The Bentway under the theme of Adaptive Reuse & Creative Misuse.
      </h2>  <br></br>
      <h2>Our reflections are on the possible futures of the internet and ways we can think about repurposing, and adapting, digital infrastructures to create equitable alternatives with us users as stewards and maintainers of protocols. Can we move beyond the impasse of internet futures based on exclusive, monetary driven, content platforms? What would a resyndicatable internet look, or feel, like?
      </h2><br></br>
      <h2>The following is an exploration of these possible web futures through a retro-futurist reading of the digital protocols that have shaped the internet. RSS, an acronym that originally stood for “RDF Site Summary” by Netscape and later evolved to “Really Simple Syndication”2, is one vignette of this study—an unrealized future of rich, interoperable, content publishing on the internet that continues to exist well after it’s start in the early dot-com bubble. A future where Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), “the language spoken by routers on the Internet to determine how packets can be sent from one router to another to reach their final destination”3, never contributed to the hyperscaling of the internet to the planetary proportions that it is today and instead skewed towards localizing, community-owned, connectivity. And, lastly, a vignette where the internet has been de-gentrified and the protocol walled-gardens we are accustomed to collapses, giving way to new forms of digital place making, maintenance, and care.

        <h5>Through the network</h5>

        <h2>The first web page was published to the World Wide Web (www) in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee, this model of information publishing and retrieval relied on structured and available information hyperlinked. Collections of pages as web sites, all available at the same domain served as early gardens for people to grow and share information in. That isn’t the web we experience currently, if we experience the web at all. As of January 2021 just shy of 60% of people are online, up from just around half the year prior.9 For that slight majority, public spaces have been gentrified and walled off, most spaces (websites and apps) make big asks of visitors: have the personal security to exchange your personal information for access (have the privilege to be real-named), have always-on and stable connectivity, don’t fall too far behind on the latest and greatest hardware treadmill or you can’t run the increasingly computationally expensive software and web apps. Also you better have lots of bandwidth because if you were to be always on data your costs would go through the roof.

        <h5>Living on the new internet</h5>        
        <h2>Quinn sometimes thought about the interfaces they encountered as they moved from one page to the next either through a click on hyperlinked text in a paragraph, or a deliberate typing of addresses given to them in passing. The action of typing out an address is straight-forward, though the translation of a friend’s scribble to the precision of the computer input has been a recurring inconvenience in remembering context on why they were navigating to the website in the first place: curiosity, feigned interest, or a last ditch effort to get at relevant information.
